Column	Description
_id	
Unique row identifier for Open Data database

Assigned_ID	
A unique ID assigned to cases by Toronto Public Health for the purposes of posting to Open Data, to allow for tracking of specific cases.

Please note, cases may be reclassified or removed from posted datasets over time. This can occur due to duplicate resolution, or other ongoing data cleaning initiatives. In such instances, the Assigned ID of that case will no longer appear on the list and will not get assigned to another case.

Outbreak Associated	
Outbreak associated cases are associated with outbreaks of COVID-19 in Toronto healthcare institutions and healthcare settings (e.g. long-term care homes, retirement homes, hospitals, etc.) and other Toronto congregate settings (such as homeless shelters).

Neighbourhood Name	
Toronto is divided into 140 geographically distinct neighborhoods that were established to help government and community agencies with local planning by providing socio-economic data for a meaningful geographic area. Please note that client postal code information is mapped to the most up-to-date census tract (CT) and neighbourhood information available from the city. As a result, neighbourhood information is not available for those with missing postal code or when postal code could not be mapped/linked to a CT.
